# Story:
A fleet of ships and a rocket are taking a select few humans to start a colony on Mars - but to their surprise as the rocket approaches the red planet and they prepare to decend, one pilot notices something strange... An unexpected space station behind the planed with hundreds of advanced ships patroling the station. As they near, the alien ships begin to attack and it's up to the accompanying ships to defend the rocket in order to land safely on Mars. Little do the humans know... Alien tech has come a long way in that black holes are being formed to call in extra reinforcements of alien nature...
